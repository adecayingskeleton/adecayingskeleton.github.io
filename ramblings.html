      and protein shake on the counter and starts fishing through her pockets for a wallet until she looks back up to a girl, brown ponytail and piercings, 
      a girl she didn't recognize. The interaction that followed was a sputtering of greetings and terms of transaction until she had spun herself out the door 
      and began trodding away with a clumsy handful of headphones, wallet, receipt, and shit food. She didn't look back as she walked. There's a new cashier at 
      the dollar store. At my dollar store.</p>

    <p>Firsts are too hard and we look on the pyramid of failure around them as an indication of continued failure. The thing that makes a first special
    is the throw of vulnerability into the void, at every step the process of art is questioned and our vulnerability threatened. It is only after the first that we realize it was all a joke to begin with,
    the act of creation is almost dreamlike, in finally detaching from our creations we see that if we had only been fully vulnerable at each turn we would have made the art that was truest to ourselves. That
    sheerly the act of creation and failure was in itself, cool. </p>
    <p>With this thought in mind there are projects I wish I could raise back from the graveyard of my mind to attone for their premature death. So much of it all is about mental health. Can, and should, one 
    attemp to make art that represents their mental plight? Maybe the idea is to make art that gives you flight from your issues, to magically invert and transmute your life to be whatever you want it to be?</p>
