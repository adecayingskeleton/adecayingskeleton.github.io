    <p>"Next in line." She walks up to the cashier nonchalantly and adjusts her hair as she takes off her headphones. She throws a chocolate bar 
      and protein shake on the counter and starts fishing through her pockets for a wallet until she looks back up to a girl, brown ponytail and piercings, 
      a girl she didn't recognize. The interaction that followed was a sputtering of greetings and terms of transaction until she had spun herself out the door 
      and began trodding away with a clumsy handful of headphones, wallet, receipt, and shit food. She didn't look back as she walked. There's a new cashier at 
      the dollar store. At my dollar store.</p>

    <p>Firsts are too hard and we look on the pyramid of failure around them as an indication of continued failure. The thing that makes a first special
    is the throw of vulnerability into the void, at every step the process of art is questioned and our vulnerability threatened. It is only after the first that we realize it was all a joke to begin with,
    the act of creation is almost dreamlike, in finally detaching from our creations we see that if we had only been fully vulnerable at each turn we would have made the art that was truest to ourselves. That
    sheerly the act of creation and failure was in itself, cool. </p>
    <p>With this thought in mind there are projects I wish I could raise back from the graveyard of my mind to attone for their premature death. So much of it all is about mental health. Can, and should, one 
    attemp to make art that represents their mental plight? Maybe the idea is to make art that gives you flight from your issues, to magically invert and transmute your life to be whatever you want it to be?</p>
    <p>Continuing on the thought of failure, failure truly is cool. I have led myself to believe in the past that others around me were judging or even internally mocking me for my failures, but playing back
    now all of those moments I often used to torture myself in my head I see no genuine scorn in the voices of people reacting to my failures. Beyond that, humans will have whatever kneejerk emotional reaction
    they have based on their stakes. No one will truly be dissapointed in you for what you tried and you failed, if what you try is lofty enough it is more likely that you would earn their awe and respect. Either way,
    it is truly foolish to get too involved in what emotions people throw at you, especially with respect to your own ambitions. So long as your ambitions aren't a direct malevolence to the world (not judging if they
    are,) then your biggest responsibility is to the ambissions that shape your meaning. </p>
    <p>I have so much to work out before I feel comfortable making art. Publishing these ramblings ANYWHERE is a better approximation for representing my thoughts with music than just keeping them in my head.</p>
    <p>I cried waiting for the bus which would take me to my first day of work this morning. Why have I passed my time so idly? Despite the incessant sense of urgency to live true to myself that penetrates every 
    corner of my life, I still shelter isolate and sabotage myself. I can't help but shake my fist madly at Capitalism and Johnny Fatcat for making me trudge in line while fighting the deepest sense of loss I've ever 
    felt. I texted my mother. I cried more on the bus. I put on easy listening music. Now I sit at the farmers market at the edge of town, waiting for a transfer. It won't be so bad if I can come by here every day.
    New beginnings are petrifying.</p>
    <p>The petrifying part of new beginnings is the fact that it comes with the realization of the amount of ends one has been through.</p>
    <p>But I'm young and I'm agitated, so fuck it, that's enough for me.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">damn wife suggest I get her a garden fountain with my money, my own 401k it is. Hate this store crowded and noisy damnable kids. Kids now nothing but queers grandson never writes back anyways. My own damn 401k that crone will suck every
