        <h1>The Birth of a Website</h1>
        <p>A website is a great steel trap filled with letters and non-real things.</p>
        <a href="ramblings.html"> Ramblings </a>
        <a href="Painting_of_Christ_in_Gethsemane.jpg"></a>
        <p>What, then, is this website? I would define decaying webiste (rip decaying.net) to be a public journal, and a place for me to organize my art and thoughts. This website's existence will incentivize
        my drift away from monolithic social media networks and my creation of art, and will stand as a testament of my achieval/non-achieval of those goals.</p>
